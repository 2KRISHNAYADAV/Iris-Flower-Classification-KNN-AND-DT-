This project is part of the **SkillHIGH Minor Project** for internship training. It focuses on building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their morphological features.

## 📊 Dataset

* Sepal Length (cm)
* Sepal Width (cm)
* Petal Length (cm)
* Petal Width (cm)

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classifies data points based on the majority label among the nearest neighbors.
* **Decision Tree**: Builds a model by splitting the dataset at each node based on feature values.

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of the classification models, the following metrics are used:

* **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
* **Confusion Matrix**: Provides insight into the true vs. predicted classifications.
* **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Offer a detailed evaluation of the model's performance, especially in imbalanced datasets.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**: Core programming language for implementation.
* **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
* **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.

## 📊 Dataset

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. Each sample has four features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

| Model       | Accuracy |
|-------------|----------|
| KNN         | ~97%     |
| Decision Tree | ~96%   |


Both models perform well on the Iris dataset, with KNN slightly outperforming Decision Tree in accuracy.
