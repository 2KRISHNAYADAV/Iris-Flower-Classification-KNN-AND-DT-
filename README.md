## 📊 Dataset

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. Each sample has four features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

| Model       | Accuracy |
|-------------|----------|
| KNN         | ~97%     |
| Decision Tree | ~96%   |


Both models perform well on the Iris dataset, with KNN slightly outperforming Decision Tree in accuracy.
